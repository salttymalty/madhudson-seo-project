## Questions?

**Why different keywords?**
- Competitors aren't owning "watches for creators" / "artist-made watches" / "watches that fund artists"
- These are uncontested niches where Mad Hudson's story is strongest
- Strategy is to own creator/artist cluster, not compete on generic "watch" keywords

**How often do reports update?**
- Weekly snapshots: Every Monday
- Monthly consolidations: End of each month
- Ad-hoc alerts: When 3+ position movement detected

**What happens after Phase 1?**
- Phase 2 includes blog launch, artist profiles, press strategy
- Continued weekly tracking throughout Phase 2 and Phase 3
- Escalate to team if major opportunities emerge

**What if a keyword moves 3+ positions?**
- Automatic flag in weekly report
- Optional deeper analysis (what changed on site? competition?)
- Recommend actions (capitalize on momentum, address regression, etc.)
