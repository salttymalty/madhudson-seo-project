# Mad Hudson SEO — Phase 1 Optimization via Multi-Agent Coordination
**Immediate SEO Quick Wins (This Week — Feb 10-16)**

---

## 🎯 What We're Doing

**Phase 1 Goal:** Move 3-5 keywords from Page 2 to top 3 by April 7 through artist-focused product page optimization.

**Strategy:** Don't compete on "watches" or "luxury watches" (competitors dominate). Own "watches for creators" (uncontested).

**Timeline:**
- **Feb 10-11:** Copywriting Coordinator briefs copywriter on Phase 1
- **Feb 12-13:** Copywriter delivers expanded product descriptions (6 watches)
- **Feb 13-14:** Copywriting Coordinator QAs copy, returns feedback
- **Feb 14-15:** Connor reviews final copy, uploads to Shopify
- **Feb 15-16:** SEO Monitor captures baseline rankings
- **Feb 17:** First ranking snapshot (SEO Monitor reports)

---

## 🚨 If Phase 1 Underperforms (Decision Gate)

**Scenario:** April 7 checkpoint shows <2 keywords moved to top 3.

**Actions:**
1. SEO Monitor analyzes why: Competitors responding? Keywords too competitive? Content quality issue?
2. Content Planner reviews: Did Phase 1 optimize for right keywords? Should we pivot positioning?
3. Decision for Connor: Continue Phase 2 anyway, or pause and revise strategy?

**Note:** This is unlikely given competitive research, but built-in safety valve.
