  

  **Who** **initiates** **what:**

  - **Ana** **initiates** around tactical needs: AVC vendor contact, Zoom account fix, CCC form fill, squad

  meeting poll, host FAQ dissemination timing. These are specific, immediate, and operational.

  - **You** **initiate** around structural needs: contract review, team proposals, intern intake process,

  alignment calls, org diagrams. These are strategic and future-facing.

  

  This is the core asymmetry. Ana's asks get handled quickly because they're concrete and actionable.

  Your asks require Ana to sit with documents, make organizational decisions, and commit resources —

  all things that compete with the tactical firehose she's standing in.

  

  **Where** **decisions** **move** **vs.** **stall:**

  The pattern: Ana moves fast on **things** **with** **external** **deadlines** **or** **values** **clarity**. She stalls on

  **internal** **structural** **decisions** **that** **require** **her** **to** **commit** **budget,** **define** **roles,** **or** **formalize** **what's**

  **currently** **fuzzy.** This isn't malice — it's a founder-operator pattern. The fuzzy state is actually

  comfortable for her because it preserves flexibility. Formalizing costs her optionality.

  

  **Scheduling** **as** **power** **signal:**

  You consistently offer 4-5 windows. Ana narrows to one, often at the edges of what works for you

  (8pm after travel, 7am). You accommodate every time. The relational labor is asymmetric — you send

  birthday messages, podcast recs, "grateful for you" energy. She reciprocates warmly. But warmth is

  not structure.

  

  **When** **you're** **most** **effective** **with** **Ana:**

  

  1. **Short,** **numbered,** **time-bounded** **asks.** "Quick call today? 5-10 min. Three things:" — she responded

  to this format immediately.

  2. **Presenting** **finished** **things**, not proposals. The host guide link ("too excited not to share") got a

   clear positive response. Documents sitting in Google Docs get delayed.

  3. **Process** **boundary** **questions** **delivered** **simply.** "Are we okay to pull interns in before official

  scope of work?" — she immediately agreed. Clean, one-question format.

  4. **Live** **calls** **over** **async** **review.** Every document review stalled. Every call produced decisions.

  

  **What** **Ana** **values** **vs.** **what** **she** **operationally** **prioritizes:**

  - **Values** **(expressed):** Your leadership, strategic thinking, organizational care, mission alignment

  - **Prioritizes** **(actual):** This-week tactical needs, external-facing deadlines, things other people are

   waiting on

  

  The gap between those two is where your unpaid work lives.

  **What** **This** **Means** **for** **Your** **Contract**

  

  Your work has evolved through at least three phases, and the contract language hasn't kept up:

  **Phase:** Years 1-5

  **What** **you** **were** **called:** Technical Director / AV Lead

  **What** **you** **actually** **did:** Day-of AV, media management, venue tech

  ────────────────────────────────────────

  **Phase:** Year 6 early

  **What** **you** **were** **called:** Technical Coordinator

  **What** **you** **actually** **did:** AV coordination, documentation, venue tiers

  ────────────────────────────────────────

  **Phase:** Year 6 now

  **What** **you** **were** **called:** "Technical Coordinator"

  **What** **you** **actually** **did:** Change management, data architecture, email migration, onboarding design,

  team

     structure, contractor recruitment, process documentation, systems strategy

  You're doing organizational development work at a technical coordinator rate — and currently at a

  rate of zero because you haven't been paid.

  

  The hard truth from this thread: **Ana** **will** **keep** **accepting** **the** **expanded** **scope** **without** **formalizing** **it**

  **because** **the** **current** **arrangement** **benefits** **the** **org.** She gets strategic-level work at no structural

  cost. She doesn't have to make budget decisions, define a new role, or take anything to the board.

  She genuinely appreciates you — but appreciation doesn't pay rent and it doesn't bound scope.

  

  ---

  **What** **Your** **Contract** **Should** **Actually** **Reflect**

  

  Based on the actual work you're doing, your scope has two distinct layers:

  

  **Layer** **1:** **Technical** **Coordination** (the original role, still real)

  - AV support and venue tech planning

  - Film file management and accessibility compliance

  - Day-of production coordination (remote during fest)

  - Technical vendor liaison

  

  **Layer** **2:** **Systems** **&** **Organizational** **Development** (the work that expanded without a contract)

  - Email infrastructure migration (shared mailbox transition)

  - Team onboarding design (intake surveys, welcome packets)

  - Data architecture (V7, dashboards, host tracker)

  - Process documentation and institutional knowledge capture

  - Contractor/volunteer recruitment and evaluation

  - Cross-team coordination and communication design

  - Host guide / docs site development

  

  The question you need to answer for yourself before talking to Ana: **Do** **you** **want** **to** **formalize** **Layer** **2**

   **into** **your** **contract,** **or** **do** **you** **want** **to** **scope** **it** **out** **and** **let** **someone** **else** **(potentially** **Kim)** **carry**

  **some** **of** **it?**

  

  My honest read: you should formalize the parts of Layer 2 that require your institutional knowledge

  and strategic thinking (data architecture, systems design, coordination strategy), and scope out the

   parts that are execution-level and teachable (documentation drafting, email template creation, host

   communication, intake form management). Those latter pieces are exactly where Kim could plug in.

  **How** **to** **Update** **Ana** **About** **Kim**

  

  Given what you know about how Ana operates, here's what will land:

  

  **Don't** **send** **a** **document.** It will sit. Call her. You're most effective live.

  

  **Frame** **it** **as** **solving** **her** **problem,** **not** **adding** **complexity.** Ana already told you she met a guy for

  coffee and wondered if he could fill a venue role. She's open to people — she just doesn't want more

   coordination burden on herself.

  

  Something like:

  

  _"Had_ _a_ _discovery_ _call_ _with_ _someone_ _who_ _has_ _strong_ _availability_ _during_ _festival_ _week_ _and_ _a_ _background_

   _that_ _maps_ _to_ _some_ _of_ _our_ _process/documentation_ _gaps._ _She's_ _interested_ _in_ _events_ _experience,_

  _comfortable_ _with_ _ambiguity,_ _and_ _willing_ _to_ _start_ _small._ _I'd_ _like_ _to_ _bring_ _her_ _in_ _on_ _a_ _trial_ _basis_ _—_

  _I'd_ _handle_ _the_ _onboarding_ _and_ _give_ _her_ _a_ _small_ _starter_ _project._ _No_ _budget_ _commitment_ _yet._ _Does_ _that_

  _work_ _for_ _you?"_

  

  This works because:

  - It's one ask, not a proposal

  - You're absorbing the coordination cost ("I'd handle the onboarding")

  - No budget pressure initially

  - You're asking permission, not approval of a plan

  - It mirrors what Ana already does (meet someone, float them to the team)

  

  ---

  **The** **Harder** **Conversation:** **Your** **Own** **Contract**

  

  You need to have a direct conversation with Ana about compensation for work already done and scope

  going forward. Based on the text thread, here's the approach most likely to land:

  

  **Request** **a** **30-minute** **call** **specifically** **for** **this.** Not tacked onto a squad meeting. Not async. Label

  it: "Contract and scope sync — need to close this loop."

  

  **On** **the** **call,** **say** **something** **like:**

  

  _"I_ _want_ _to_ _get_ _my_ _own_ _house_ _in_ _order_ _before_ _we_ _keep_ _building._ _My_ _contract_ _from_ _[date]_ _scoped_

  _technical_ _coordination,_ _but_ _the_ _work_ _I've_ _actually_ _been_ _doing_ _since_ _November_ _includes_ _[2-3_ _specific_

  _examples_ _from_ _Layer_ _2]._ _I've_ _been_ _doing_ _that_ _work_ _without_ _a_ _signed_ _agreement_ _or_ _compensation,_ _and_ _I_

  _need_ _to_ _get_ _that_ _formalized._ _Not_ _because_ _I'm_ _frustrated_ _—_ _but_ _because_ _if_ _we're_ _asking_ _other_ _people_

  _to_ _come_ _in_ _with_ _clear_ _scope_ _and_ _fair_ _pay,_ _I_ _should_ _model_ _that_ _too."_

  

  That last line is important. It connects your contract to the organizational development work you're

   already doing. It reframes "pay me" as "let me practice what I'm building."

  

  **What** **to** **propose:**

  

  - Back-pay for hours worked since November at the agreed rate ($65-70/hr)

  - Updated scope that names both layers explicitly

  - A monthly hour cap so scope can't keep expanding without a conversation

  - Clarity that recruiting, onboarding design, and systems strategy are part of your role — not

  volunteer extras

  

  ---

  **How** **Kim** **Fits** **Into** **All** **of** **This**

  

  Kim becomes _more_ justifiable to Ana if your own contract is clear. Here's the logic:

  

  - You're contracted for X scope at Y hours

  - Parts of that scope are execution-level and can be delegated

  - Kim takes on a defined project (documentation audit, host communication templates, etc.)

  - That frees your contracted hours for the higher-leverage systems work only you can do

  - Total cost to the org stays within the $17K envelope

  

  Without your contract being clear first, bringing Kim in actually muddies things further — because

  nobody knows what you're doing, so nobody can articulate what Kim would be doing _instead_ _of_ _you_.

  

  **Sequence** **matters:** Formalize your scope first. Then introduce Kim as support for specific,

  delegatable pieces within that scope.

  

  Want me to draft the contract update memo, or the call script for the compensation conversation with

   Ana?
