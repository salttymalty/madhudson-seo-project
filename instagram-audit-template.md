## 1. Profile Snapshot

Fill in from analyzer tool:

| Metric | Value | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Followers | | |
| Following | | |
| Total posts | | |
| Engagement rate | | Benchmark: 3-5% is healthy for micro/small brands |
| Avg likes per post | | |
| Avg comments per post | | |
| Posting frequency | | Benchmark: 3-5x/week |
| Audience quality score | | HypeAuditor only — flags fake/bot followers |

## 2. Brad's Personal Account Comparison

Brad (@brad_podray / @scumbagdadofficial) is the primary traffic driver. Understanding the gap between Brad's reach and MH's own audience is critical.

| Metric | Brad | @madhudsonwatches | Ratio |
|--------|------|-------------------|-------|
| Followers | ~1.5M IG / ~6.2M TikTok | | |
| Avg engagement | | | |
| When Brad posts MH content, does it appear on the MH account too? | | | |

**Key question:** Is MH building its own audience, or renting Brad's? If Brad stops posting tomorrow, what happens to traffic?

## 4. Grid Coherence (3-Second Test)

Open the profile on your phone. Answer in 3 seconds:

- [ ] Can you tell what this brand sells?
- [ ] Does the grid have a visual rhythm (not just random shots)?
- [ ] Is there a consistent color palette or mood?
- [ ] Would you tap "follow" based on the grid alone?

**One-sentence impression:** _______________

## 5. Profile Elements

| Element | Current State | Issue? |
|---------|--------------|--------|
| Bio text | | Clear value prop in under 150 chars? |
| Profile pic | | Recognizable at small size? |
| Link-in-bio destination | | Where does it go? Homepage, shop, Linktree, specific product? |
| Link-in-bio mobile UX | | Does the landing page load fast and look good on phone? |
| Story Highlights | | Are they organized? (collabs, BTS, drops, press) |
| CTA in bio | | Is there a reason to click? |

## 6. Captions and Engagement Hooks

Look at the last 5 captions:

- [ ] Do captions tell a story or just describe the product?
- [ ] Do any captions end with a question or call to action?
- [ ] Are artist collaborators tagged and credited?
- [ ] Are hashtags used? How many per post? (3-5 is current best practice)
- [ ] Is the brand voice consistent with the madstream manifesto tone — irreverent, experimental, warm?

## 7. The Conversion Bridge

This is where Instagram metrics connect to the Shopify data you already have.

### Known Data (From SEO Audit, Jan-Feb 2026)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Instagram sessions to site | 60,615 |
| Orders attributed to Instagram | 23 |
| Instagram conversion rate | 0.038% |
| Mobile % of Instagram traffic | 93% |
| Unattributed orders (some likely IG) | 179 ($28.3K) |
| Google organic conversion rate | ~7x higher than IG |

### Bridge Questions

**Traffic quality:**
- Does the IG engagement rate suggest real audience or inflated numbers? _______________
- If audience quality score is available, what %? _______________

**Content-to-click alignment:**
- Do the highest-engagement posts match what's on the product pages? _______________
- Is there a tone gap between IG (personality, energy) and site (sparse, transactional)? _______________

**Attribution gap:**
- Has UTM tracking been added to link-in-bio yet? _______________
- If yes, what does one month of UTM data show? _______________
- If no, this is still the single highest-leverage diagnostic move.

**Post-click experience:**
- Open the link-in-bio URL on your phone right now. Does it feel like the same brand as the IG feed? _______________
- How many taps from link-in-bio to "add to cart"? _______________
- Are trust signals visible above the fold on mobile? (reviews, guarantee, Shop Pay) _______________
