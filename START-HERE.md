## 🔑 The Core Insight

**Opportunity:** Competitors aren't owning keywords like "watches for creators," "artist-made watches," "watches that fund artists."

**Mad Hudson's Advantage:** Artist-as-author positioning, transparent creator economics, warm accessibility.

**Strategy:** Stop competing for generic "watch" keywords. Own the creator/artist cluster where Mad Hudson's story is strongest.

**Keywords to Own (Uncontested):**
- ⭐ "watches for creators"
- "artist-made watches"
- "watches that fund artists"
- "pre-order watches with artist stories"
- "beautiful watch design"
- "independent watch brand"
- "Chicago watch brand"
