# madstream // madman — Content Platform Deck

**Source:** `madstream __ madman.pptx` (archived from Downloads 2026-02-15)
**Origin era:** Pre-cease-and-desist (brand was "madman" before becoming "Mad Hudson")
**Type:** Internal strategy deck — madstream content platform concept

## What This Is

madstream is Mad Hudson's experimental content platform concept. A creative playground and brand expression space hosting artist collaborations, short-form video, AI experiences, written work, playlists, and more. Designed to explore ideas beyond product — testing concepts, telling stories, building community through unconventional formats.

Key positioning line: **"The madness feeds the watches. The watches feed the madman."**

## Platform Philosophy

- madstream isn't a scroll — it's a **shuffle**
- Each click sends you somewhere new — completely random, completely intentional
- Nonlinear structure encourages exploration through fragmented, unpredictable storytelling
- No categories, no guides — every experience is distinct
- Referenced inspirations: **Because-Recollection** and **Radiohead** (desktop experiences)

## Content Concepts by Contributor

### "madman" (Brand Voice)

1. **Madman Chatbot** — AI chatbot that speaks in riddles, gets distracted, leaves you more confused
2. **Scribbles of a Madman** — Short stories taking an unconventional look at time
3. **Madman Playlists** — Volumes of music people can save and listen to
4. **Quench the Madness** — Off-the-rails cocktail recipes (and food)
5. **Madman Photo Filter** — Webcam/Zoom filter turning you into the madman or something else

### Riki Prosper

1. **Albums as Watches** — Riki's viral concept: watch designs inspired by classic album covers (click to zoom)
2. **Free Youngboy** — Gameplay video, link to app store download, art directed by Riki
3. **Prospermon** — Interactive virtual pack opening of Riki's Prospermon cards inspired by music legends

### Bryce

1. **Say Uncle** — Video, possibly the 1992 Pinch Headlock technique video from Mike Houck
2. **Hot Dog** — Video of Bryce making a perfect hot dog, hot dog bowl, or the corndog helmet
3. **Transforming Dog** — Clickable slideshow: click through transforming a pair of hands to a dog head

### Brad

1. **Live Feed** — Either a legitimate live feed or a "24 hour" loop where strange things happen throughout the day
2. **Unhinged Chat Room** — Classic AOL chat room where site visitors can communicate (must be heavily filtered for language)

## Production Notes

- All ideas must be simple and easy to execute — if not, cut and replace
- Combo of artist features, madman contributions, and (eventually) shoppable brand/product features
- Content needed: several short stories, playlist volumes 1 & 2, AI chatbot, photo filter, recipes, short videos from Brad, ideas from Bryce/Riki, designs from Hannah, open to anyone who wants to jump in

## Manifesto Text

> madman isn't just a watch brand. It's a creative engine. A glitch in the system.
>
> madstream is our floodgate. A stream of chaos, beauty, and experimentation — forever flowing. It's where we play, test, break, rebuild, and release the madness.
>
> Short films. Strange poems. Glitches in reality. Photoshoots that shouldn't have happened, but did. Stories that start and never end.
>
> madstream is the fever dream. The watches are the proof it happened. A daily reminder that you exist in this world while the madness persists.
>
> We don't just tell time. We'll tell whatever the hell we want. You can wear the madness. Or fall right into it.

## Strategic Relevance (2026)

This deck predates the cease-and-desist that renamed the brand to "Mad Hudson." The creative DNA here — artist collaborations, nonlinear storytelling, brand-as-creative-engine — is still the core of what makes Mad Hudson distinctive. Useful reference points:

- **Content strategy:** The madstream concept directly informs Instagram content strategy. The "shuffle" philosophy maps to varied, personality-driven posting rather than product-only feeds.
- **Artist collaboration framework:** Named contributors (Riki, Bryce, Brad, Hannah) with distinct content types per artist. This is the collaboration model still in use.
- **Brand voice:** The manifesto captures the irreverent, experimental tone that should carry through all channels.
- **Product-content relationship:** "The watches are the proof it happened" — watches as artifacts of creative energy, not just products. This framing could strengthen product page copy.
- **Platform ambition:** madstream as a standalone experience suggests the brand has always wanted to be more than a Shopify storefront. Could inform future site architecture decisions.
