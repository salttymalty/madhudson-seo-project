## Accuracy Notes

These documents were produced with AI-assisted research in December 2025. Known caveats:
- COGS estimates are directional, not verified with Mad Hudson's actual supplier invoices
- Tariff rates may have shifted since December 2025
- Some competitive intelligence may be outdated
- Brad Podray's follower count referenced as "6M+" — should be verified
- The "Macy's partnership" is described as B2B design work, not wholesale — verify current status
