## 🔐 SECURITY & DATA GOVERNANCE

### **Sensitive Information to Protect**

1. **Google Search Console Access**
   - Contains keyword data (search behavior)
   - Competitive intelligence visible
   - Access control: Connor + authorized team only

2. **Google Analytics**
   - Traffic patterns
   - User behavior data
   - Access control: Read-only for external consultants

3. **Shopify Admin Access**
   - Product pricing, inventory, customer data
   - Artist info (if contractually sensitive)
   - Access control: Limited to team members

4. **Artist Information**
   - Personal details, contact info
   - Commission structures
   - Revenue splits
   - Access control: Private, shared only with team

5. **Competitive Research**
   - Competitor strategies, pricing, keyword targeting
   - May be sensitive if sharing externally
   - Access control: Internal only

### **Access Control Framework**

**Public (Can share widely):**
- General brand positioning
- Public rankings data
- Blog content strategy
- Press announcements

**Internal Only (Connor's team):**
- GSC raw data
- Artist economics
- Revenue/commission details
- Shopify configuration
- Specific competitor pricing

**External (Only with NDA):**
- Detailed competitive analysis
- Specific traffic numbers
- Artist personal information
- Negotiated on case-by-case basis

### **API Key & Credential Management**

**For Multi-Agent Work:**
- [ ] Store GSC credentials in environment variables (never in code)
- [ ] Use OAuth 2.0 for Shopify API access (not API keys)
- [ ] Use read-only API scopes where possible
- [ ] Rotate credentials quarterly
- [ ] Log all API access for audit trail
- [ ] Use Claude's built-in context isolation (agents can't see each other's prompts)

**For External Contractors:**
- [ ] Contractor access to read-only versions of data
- [ ] No direct Shopify admin access (share reports instead)
- [ ] NDA signed before sharing competitor analysis
- [ ] Time-limited access (revoke when contract ends)

### **Data Minimization**

When sharing with agents/contractors, share only what they need:
- Copywriter: Artist bios + brand guidelines (not analytics, not GSC data)
- Developer: Shopify theme files + product schema (not artist contracts)
- PR: Public brand story + media contacts (not revenue data)

## ⚠️ RISK MITIGATION

**Risk: Phase 1 doesn't move rankings**
- *Cause:* Competitor moved up, or changes weren't indexed properly
- *Mitigation:* Check GSC Coverage tab, verify Shopify updates were published, wait another 2 weeks
- *Fallback:* Review copywriting quality, consider hiring copywriter if you DIY'd

**Risk: Blog doesn't generate traffic**
- *Cause:* Topics don't match search demand, or promotion is weak
- *Mitigation:* Research keywords first, amplify on social, guest post elsewhere
- *Fallback:* Pause blog, refocus on product page optimization

**Risk: Can't afford Phase 2**
- *Cause:* Budget constraints
- *Mitigation:* Do Phase 1 well first (highest ROI), pause Phase 2, restart when budget available
- *Fallback:* DIY blog (2 posts/month = 4-6 hours), focus on organic reach

**Risk: Team is too busy for ongoing content**
- *Cause:* Capacity constraints
- *Mitigation:* Start with 1 post/month (instead of 2), use agents to handle planning
- *Fallback:* Outsource to copywriter/agency retainer ($500-1000/month)
