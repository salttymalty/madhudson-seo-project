## Methodology Notes

### Manual Ranking Verification (Baseline)
1. Google Search (incognito mode, no location targeting)
2. Check first 3 pages (30 results) for each keyword
3. Record exact position if visible
4. Note SERP features (featured snippet, People Also Ask, etc.)
5. Manual ranking verification until GSC is configured

### Once Google Search Console is Live
- Shift to GSC data for primary tracking (more accurate)
- Compare manual verification monthly for validation
- Track impressions, clicks, avg. position, CTR

### Movement Threshold
- **Alert Trigger:** 3+ position movement (up or down)
- **Direction:** ↑ (up), ↓ (down), — (no change)
- **Action:** Flag in weekly report + recommend response

---

## Baseline Analysis

### Strengths (Current State)
- **Unique keyword cluster:** "watches for creators," "artist-made watches," "watches that fund artists" are largely uncontested
- **Emerging presence:** Already on Page 2 for related keywords ("artist watches," "pre-order watches")
- **Low competition baseline:** Opportunity to establish authority early

### Gaps (Current State)
- **No primary keyword ranking:** "watches for creators" not in top 30
- **Page 2 barrier:** Most target keywords stuck at Page 2, suggesting on-page optimization gaps
- **Content gaps:** Missing artist story integration, schema markup, breadcrumb implementation

### Phase 2 Goals
1. Move 3-5 keywords from Page 2 to top 3 (8 weeks)
2. Establish first ranking for "watches for creators" (8-12 weeks)
3. Capture "watches that fund artists" uncontested niche (8 weeks)

---

## Next Steps

1. **This Week (Feb 9-15):** Monitor Phase 1 execution
2. **Feb 16 (Sunday):** Capture first weekly snapshot
3. **Feb 17 (Monday):** Publish WEEKLY-2026-02-17 report
4. **Ongoing:** Weekly snapshots every Monday at 9 AM
