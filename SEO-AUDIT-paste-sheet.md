## Executive Summary — Patterns and Consistency

### Systemic Issues Found

1. **Brand name inconsistency** — "Mad Hudson" vs "Mad Hudson Watches"
   - Broken Time, CD Watch, Marshall, Miami use "Mad Hudson"
   - Dogma, Eddie use "Mad Hudson Watches"
   - **Fix:** Standardize to "Mad Hudson Watches" everywhere for stronger brand recognition

2. **Title tag separator inconsistency** — Em-dash (—) vs pipe (|)
   - All product titles use em-dash before "Limited Edition Artist Watch"
   - Then pipe before brand name
   - Eddie/Marshall/Miami deviate with feature-first format
   - **Fix:** Standardize pattern: `[Product] by [Artist] — Limited Edition Artist Watch | Mad Hudson Watches`

3. **Alt text redundancy** — Several include "photo of" or "image of" patterns
   - Most avoid this (good)
   - Banner alt text is too generic ("Mad Hudson Watches — Wear the Madness tagline")
   - **Fix:** Remove implied image references, make banner alt text more descriptive

4. **Alt text word order** — Inconsistent prioritization
   - Some lead with product name (good): "Broken Time watch by Brad Podray..."
   - Some lead with generic descriptor: "Close-up of Broken Time dial..."
   - **Fix:** Always lead with product name + artist when applicable

5. **Meta description punctuation** — Mix of em-dashes, periods, commas
   - Broken Time: em-dash + period + period
   - CD Watch: em-dash + period + period
   - Dogma: em-dash + period + period + comma-free
   - Eddie/Marshall/Miami: em-dash + comma + period + period
   - **Fix:** Pick one rhythm and apply consistently

6. **Meta description length** — All compliant but some verbose
   - All are exactly or very close to 160 chars (good targeting)
   - Some feel cramped, others flow naturally
   - **Fix:** Minor edits for breathing room

7. **Missing artist attribution in in-house products**
   - Eddie, Marshall, Miami have no artist name
   - Title tags don't follow "by [Artist]" pattern (makes sense — in-house)
   - Alt text doesn't mention designer/creator
   - **Fix:** This is intentional differentiation — PASS, but consider adding "designed by Mad Hudson" in alt text for consistency

## Product-by-Product Breakdown

### 1. Broken Time (Brad Podray)

#### Page Title
**Current:** `Broken Time by Brad Podray — Limited Edition Artist Watch | Mad Hudson`
**Length:** 67 chars
**Issue:** Brand name should be "Mad Hudson Watches" for consistency
**Suggested:** `Broken Time by Brad Podray — Limited Edition Artist Watch | Mad Hudson Watches`
**New length:** 75 chars (over ideal 60-70 range but under 70 hard limit)
**Rationale:** Brand consistency matters more than saving 8 chars.

---

#### Meta Description
**Current:** `Broken Time by Brad Podray — a smashed-crystal timepiece from visual artist and internet anarchist Brad Podray. Limited to 100 pieces. Artist collaboration from Mad Hudson.`
**Length:** 160 chars
**Issues:**
1. Artist name repeated twice ("Brad Podray" appears in first phrase and again in second)
2. "Artist collaboration from Mad Hudson" is awkward phrasing
3. No CTA or emotional hook at end
4. "Internet anarchist" is strong language — verify this is Connor-approved

**Suggested:** `Broken Time by Brad Podray — a smashed-crystal timepiece from visual artist and internet anarchist. Limited to 100 pieces. Free shipping, 1-year warranty.`
**New length:** 159 chars
**Rationale:** Remove redundant artist name, add CTA (free shipping/warranty), tighten phrasing. "Internet anarchist" is distinctive enough to keep if accurate.

---

#### Alt Text 1 — Hero Image
**Current:** `Broken Time watch by Brad Podray with smashed crystal dial on black background — Mad Hudson limited edition`
**Length:** 110 chars

---

#### Alt Text 2 — Dial Close-up

---

---

### 4. Eddie Watch (In-House)

#### Page Title
**Current:** `Eddie Watch — Square Dress Watch, Limited to 100 | Mad Hudson Watches`
**Length:** 68 chars
**Issue:** Inconsistent pattern — this is feature-first, not artist-first (correct for in-house, but breaks pattern)
**Alternative:** Keep as-is since it's in-house, OR use: `Eddie Watch — Square Dress Watch by Mad Hudson | Limited to 100`
**Rationale:** For in-house products, feature-first makes sense. But consider standardizing all titles to product name + descriptor + brand + edition for scannability.

**PASS (with note)** — This is intentional differentiation for in-house vs. collaboration. Pattern break is strategic.

---

#### Meta Description
**Current:** `The Eddie Watch — a square dress watch with deep blue layered dial, cream accents, and red details. Named after Grandpa Eddie. Limited to 100 pieces. By Mad Hudson, Chicago.`
**Length:** 160 chars (exactly at limit)

1. "The Eddie Watch" — drop "The" for consistency
2. "By Mad Hudson, Chicago" — brand name should be "Mad Hudson Watches"
3. Emotional hook is strong ("Named after Grandpa Eddie")

**Suggested:** `Eddie Watch — a square dress watch with deep blue layered dial, cream accents, and red details. Named after Grandpa Eddie. Limited to 100. Free shipping.`

---

#### Alt Text 4 — Banner
**Current:** `Mad Hudson Watches — Wear the Madness tagline`
**Length:** 48 chars

**Suggested:** `Wear the Madness — Mad Hudson Watches brand message`
**New length:** 54 chars
**Alternative:** `Mad Hudson Watches brand banner with Wear the Madness tagline and illustrated characters`
**Alt length:** 90 chars
**Rationale:** If this is a decorative banner with the tagline text, the alt should describe the visual (characters, layout) not just repeat the text. If it's ONLY text, alt should be empty or match the visible text exactly.

**NEEDS CONTEXT:** What's in this banner image? Just text? Text + illustration? If decorative with visible text, alt can be minimal.

---

## Priority Fixes

### Critical (Do First)
1. **Standardize brand name** — Change all instances of "Mad Hudson" to "Mad Hudson Watches" (7 title tags, 12+ alt texts, 3 meta descriptions)
2. **Remove redundant artist names in meta descriptions** — Broken Time, Dogma (2 products)
3. **Fix alt text word order** — Lead with product name, not "Close-up of..." (6 alt texts)

### High Priority
4. **Add brand name to alt texts** — 12 alt texts missing brand mention (keyword density + consistency)
5. **Tighten meta descriptions** — Add CTAs (free shipping, warranty) where "Chicago" location is cut (3 products)
6. **Remove jargon** — "IP" should be removed or spelled out (2 alt texts)

### Medium Priority
7. **Fix title tag length overages** — CD Watch, Marshall (after brand standardization, both are 74-78 chars)
8. **Standardize meta description punctuation** — Pick one rhythm (em-dash + period OR em-dash + comma) and apply to all 6
9. **Clarify banner alt text** — "Wear the Madness" banners need better context (what's in the image besides text?)

### Low Priority (Polish)
10. **Review "The [Product]" pattern** — Some products use "The Eddie Watch," others don't — decide and standardize
11. **Consider artist attribution for in-house products** — Eddie, Marshall, Miami could say "designed by Mad Hudson Watches" in alt text for consistency with collaboration products

---

## Recommendations for Connor

1. **Brand name decision:** Commit to "Mad Hudson Watches" everywhere. "Mad Hudson" alone is less searchable and less distinctive.

2. **Title tag template for products:**
   - **Collaborations:** `[Product] by [Artist] — Limited Edition Artist Watch | Mad Hudson Watches`
   - **In-House:** `[Product] — [Feature] Watch, Limited to 100 | Mad Hudson Watches`

3. **Alt text template:**
   - **Hero/product shots:** `[Product] by [Artist/Brand] — [visual description] — Mad Hudson Watches [context]`
   - **Detail shots:** `[Product] [detail type] — [specific visual elements] by [Artist/Brand]`
   - **Lifestyle shots:** `[Product] by [Artist] worn on wrist — [specs] by Mad Hudson Watches`

4. **Meta description template:**
   - Open with product + artist (if collaboration)
   - Add one sensory or emotional hook
   - Include edition size
   - Close with CTA (free shipping, warranty, etc.)
   - Keep between 150-160 chars

5. **Before publishing:** Run all text through a character counter and brand name checker. Inconsistencies like "Mad Hudson" vs "Mad Hudson Watches" hurt both brand recognition and SEO.
