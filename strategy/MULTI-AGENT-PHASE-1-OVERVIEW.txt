MAD HUDSON WATCHES — PHASE 1 MULTI-AGENT SEO OPTIMIZATION
Complete Overview & Deployment Guide
================================================================================

GOAL: Move 3-5 keywords from Page 2 to top 3 by April 7, 2026
      via artist-focused product page expansion

================================================================================
🎯 THE STRATEGY
================================================================================

CURRENT STATE:
  - 6 product pages: 2-3 sentences each
  - Keywords: Page 2+ (not ranking)
  - Traffic: 10-20 organic visits/month
  - Positioning: Generic e-commerce

OPPORTUNITY:
  - Competitors NOT owning "watches for creators" keyword cluster
  - Mad Hudson's unique angle: artist-as-author storytelling
  - Uncontested positioning = fastest path to ranking

PHASE 1 SOLUTION:
  - Expand each product page: 2-3 sentences → 500-1000 words
  - Add artist narrative: bio, collaboration story, design process
  - Update metadata: H1, meta description, alt text, schema markup
  - Target keywords naturally throughout content

EXPECTED RESULT (April 7):
  - "watches for creators": Page 2+ → Top 3 ✅
  - "artist-made watches": Page 2+ → Top 3 ✅
  - "artist collaboration watch": Page 2+ → Top 3 ✅
  - 3-4 more keywords moving toward top 3 ✅
  - Organic traffic: 10-20 → 30-50 visits/month ✅
