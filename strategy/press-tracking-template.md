## ✉️ PITCH EMAIL TEMPLATE (Copy-Paste Ready)

**Subject Line Options:**
```
[Choose ONE - vary by publication]
1. Artist-as-Author Watch Collaboration [Watch Name] × [Artist Name]
2. Story Pitch: Independent Watch Brand + Artist Partnership
3. Feature Story: Limited Edition Design × Artist [Watch Name]
4. Design Case Study: How [Artist Name] Designed a Watch

```

**Email Body:**
```
Hi [Editor Name],

[PERSONALIZATION - 1-2 sentences specific to their recent coverage]
I've noticed your recent coverage of [specific article/theme from publication].
You clearly value [what they value: authentic collaborations / artist-led design /
creative economics].

[THE HOOK - 2-3 sentences]
I'm reaching out with a story that aligns perfectly with that editorial voice.
Mad Hudson is an independent watch brand with a unique approach to artist collaboration:
they position artists as *authors* rather than endorsers. Each limited-edition watch
is designed by a collaborating artist, and pre-order revenue funds that artist's next work.

[THE ANGLE - 2-3 sentences]
[Choose angle based on publication - see templates in main press report]

[WHAT YOU'RE OFFERING - 2-3 sentences]
I have interview access with [Artist Name], process documentation, and high-res imagery
if you'd like to explore a feature story.

[CALL TO ACTION - 1 sentence]
Would you be interested in exploring this?

Best,
[Your Name]
[Contact Info]
[Optional: LinkedIn URL if relevant]
```

## 📬 RESPONSE SCENARIOS & PLAYBOOKS

### **SCENARIO 1: Interested / Request for Materials**

**Editor Says:** "This sounds interesting. Can you send us images and more information?"

**Your Action Plan:**
1. Respond within 24 hours
2. Attach: 5-10 high-res images, artist bio, brand overview, technical specs
3. Include: Artist availability for interview (date/time options)
4. Add: Link to website + any press kit (if available)
5. Close with: "Let me know if you need anything else. Happy to make this as easy as possible."
6. Update tracker: Status = "Interested," note any follow-up needed

**Timeline:** Usually 1-2 weeks for editor to determine next steps

---

### **SCENARIO 2: Request for Exclusivity**

**Editor Says:** "We're interested, but we'd need exclusivity for X weeks/months."

**Your Action Plan:**
1. **Clarify what they mean:** Exclusive interview? Exclusive feature? Exclusive first publication?
2. **Discuss timing:** Can you commit to their timeline?
3. **Communicate with team:** Check if other pitches need to be paused
4. **Confirm in writing:** "Yes, we can offer exclusivity until [date]"
5. Update tracker: Status = "Exclusive Agreement," note dates

**Note:** Some publications value exclusivity + will move faster if granted. Weigh speed vs. other opportunities.

---

### **SCENARIO 3: Declined / Not Interested**

**Editor Says:** "Thanks, but this doesn't fit our editorial focus right now."

**Your Action Plan:**
1. Note gracefully: "Thanks for considering. We appreciate the feedback."
2. No follow-up pitch (they've given you an answer)
3. Update tracker: Status = "Declined," date
4. Move on (don't waste time chasing uninterested editors)

**Note:** Some publications decline this month but might be interested in *different angle* later. You can revisit in 2-3 months with fresh story (but only if significantly different).

---

### **SCENARIO 4: No Response After 2 Weeks**

**Action Plan:**
1. Send one brief follow-up email (week 2):
   ```
   Subject: Following up: [Watch Name] Story Pitch

   Hi [Editor Name],

   Just following up on the pitch I sent on [date] about Mad Hudson's artist collaboration model.
   If this doesn't feel like a fit right now, no worries—just wanted to check in case it got lost
   in the inbox.

   Let me know if you'd like any additional information.

   Best,
   [Your Name]
   ```
2. Update tracker: Note follow-up sent
3. Wait another 2 weeks
4. If still no response: Update status to "No Response," close out, move on

**Rule:** Never send more than 2 emails to same editor (one pitch + one follow-up maximum)

---

### **SCENARIO 5: In Progress / Under Assignment**

**Editor Says:** "Great idea. We're assigning this to [Writer Name]. They'll reach out directly."

**Your Action Plan:**
1. Update tracker: Status = "In Progress," writer name, expected timeline
2. Expect writer contact within 3-5 business days
3. When writer contacts you:
   - Respond quickly to interview/material requests
   - Provide high-res images as needed
   - Confirm availability for artist interview
   - Suggest publication timing (if applicable)
4. Track publication: Note when article goes live
5. Capture backlink: Screenshot + save URL to backlink database

**Timeline:** Usually 2-6 weeks from assignment to publication (varies by publication)

---

### **SCENARIO 6: Published / Backlink Acquired**

**Action Plan:**
1. Monitor for article publication (sign up for Google Alerts, check publication weekly)
2. When article publishes:
   - Screenshot article
   - Extract backlink URL (the article permalink)
   - Save to backlink tracking database
   - Send thank you email to editor: "Thank you for featuring Mad Hudson. We loved [specific element]. Readers will appreciate [why it matters]."
3. Update tracker: Status = "Published," backlink URL
4. Share internally: "We got a feature in [Publication]. Read it here: [URL]"
5. Consider: Amplify on social media (if appropriate)

**Backlink Documentation:**
```
