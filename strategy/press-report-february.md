## 🎯 STORY ANGLES FOR MAD HUDSON

### **Angle 1: "Artist-as-Author" Model**
**Hook:** Unlike typical brand collaborations, Mad Hudson positions artists as authors—not accessories to the brand story. The watch tells *their* story, funded by their community.

**Best For:** It's Nice That, Designboom, Dezeen, Creative Review, Eye on Design, Design Milk
**Tone:** "Transparency meets artistry"
**Why It Works:** Fits design publication's interest in ethical design, emerging voices, and creative economics.

---

### **Angle 2: Limited Edition Culture & Scarcity as Meaning**
**Hook:** Pre-orders fund artist next work. 100-piece limits aren't about exclusivity—they're about intent. Each watch is sustainable, artist-backed, and tied to real creativity.

**Best For:** Wallpaper*, Creative Review, DIELINE, Fast Company
**Tone:** "Design with purpose"
**Why It Works:** Aligns with luxury publications' interest in meaningful scarcity + sustainability + artist economics.

---

### **Angle 3: Independent Watch Brand Positioning**
**Hook:** In a market dominated by traditional watchmakers and tech companies, Mad Hudson offers a third way: watches *for* creators, made *with* artists, funded by community pre-orders.

**Best For:** Hodinkee, Worn & Wound, A Blog To Watch
**Tone:** "Authentic watchmaking meets artist community"
**Why It Works:** Watch media loves authentic stories. Mad Hudson's artist-centric model differentiates from competitors.

---

### **Angle 4: Creator Economy & Transparent Economics**
**Hook:** Show backer economics: How much of revenue goes to artist? What does pre-order funding enable? How does community shape product?

**Best For:** Fast Company, The Verge, Eye on Design
**Tone:** "The future of creator funding"
**Why It Works:** Aligns with publication's coverage of emerging business models, creator platforms, and transparent supply chains.

---

### **Angle 5: Design Process & Craftsmanship**
**Hook:** Deep dive into how an artist (e.g., Brad Podray, Bryce Wong) designed their specific watch. What inspired? What material choices? Why this collaboration?

**Best For:** Designboom, Dezeen, Wallpaper*, Design Milk, DIELINE
**Tone:** "The artistry behind the dial"
**Why It Works:** Design publications love process stories. Shows authentic collaboration + creative thinking.

## ✉️ CUSTOMIZED PITCH TEMPLATES

### **TEMPLATE 1: Design Publication Pitch (It's Nice That, Designboom, Dezeen)**

```
Subject: Artist-as-Author Watch Collaboration [Watch Name] × [Artist Name]

Hi [Editor Name],

I'm reaching out with a story that sits at the intersection of design, art, and community economics—
something I think would resonate with your readers.

Mad Hudson is an independent watch brand with a unique approach to artist collaboration. Rather than
hiring artists as contractors, they position them as *authors*. Each limited-edition watch tells the
artist's story, funded by pre-orders that go directly to supporting the artist's next work.

The latest collaboration: [Watch Name], designed by [Artist Name]. In this partnership, [Artist] led
the design vision—material choices, mechanical features, visual language—all reflecting their artistic
practice and philosophy. The result isn't a branded collaboration; it's a watch that *is* the artist's
statement.

I think your readers—who care about authentic design and emerging creative voices—would find this story
compelling. It touches on:
- Artist economics in the digital age
- Limited edition culture as meaning (not exclusivity)
- Independent brand positioning
- The intersection of functional design and fine art

Would you be interested in a feature interview with [Artist] about the design process and what this
collaboration means for their practice? Or a brand story about how Mad Hudson works with artists differently?

I have high-res images of the watch, the artist at work, and process documentation if you'd like to explore further.

Let me know if this resonates.

Best,
[Your Name]
[Contact Info]

### **TEMPLATE 2: Watch Blog Pitch (Hodinkee, Worn & Wound, A Blog To Watch)**

```
Subject: Story Pitch: Artist-Designed Limited Edition Watch [Watch Name]

Hi [Editor Name],

I've got a story that might interest your audience: an emerging independent watch brand taking a different
approach to artist collaboration.

Mad Hudson positions artists as creative *partners*, not marketing add-ons. Each limited-edition watch is
designed by a collaborating artist, and pre-order revenue funds the artist's next work. It's a model that
combines functional watchmaking with genuine artistic intent.

The case study: [Watch Name], designed by [Artist Name]. [Artist] approached this as a creative project,
not a commercial endorsement. The results tell a story—in every detail from materials to mechanics—about
their creative practice.

Why this matters to your readers:
- Authenticity in artist collaborations (increasingly rare)
- Independent watch brand doing something genuinely different
- Artist economics + community funding (creator platform angle)
- Design process story (accessible to watch enthusiasts and designers alike)

I have:
- Interview access with artist + brand founder
- Process documentation
- Technical specs + design philosophy
- High-res photography

Would you be interested in a feature story or interview?

Best,
[Your Name]
```

### **TEMPLATE 3: Luxury/Culture Publication Pitch (Wallpaper*, Creative Review, Fast Company)**

```
Subject: Feature Story: Limited Edition Watch × Artist Collaboration [Watch Name]

Hi [Editor Name],

I'm sharing an emerging brand story that bridges three areas your coverage has been strong on: independent
design, artist economics, and limited-edition culture.

**The Story:**
Mad Hudson is rethinking artist collaboration. Rather than a typical brand-artist partnership, they've
built a model where artists are *authors*. Each limited-edition watch is designed by an artist, with
pre-order revenue funding that artist's next creative project. The watch becomes a statement of the artist's
vision—not the brand's.

**The Angle:**
[Choice of: Artist-as-author positioning / Limited edition culture / Creator economy / Design process story]

**Why It Matters:**
- In a crowded luxury goods market, Mad Hudson offers authenticity (actual artist intent, not celebrity endorsement)
- Transparent creator economics (pre-orders fund artists)
- Design-led storytelling (each watch is a narrative, not a product)
- Emerging independent brand challenging traditional watch industry norms

**Interview Access:**
- [Artist Name] (designer of [Watch Name])
- [Founder Name] (Mad Hudson founder/creative director)
- Process documentation + exclusive imagery

I think this aligns well with your readers' interests in:
[Design culture / Emerging brands / Artist economics / Meaningful scarcity / Transparent business models]

Would you be interested in exploring this?

Best,
[Your Name]
```

### **TEMPLATE 4: Packaging/Design Blog Pitch (DIELINE, Design Milk, Creative Bloq)**

```
Subject: Design Case Study: Limited Edition Watch Packaging × Artist Branding

Hi [Editor Name],

I have a design case study submission that combines artist collaboration with purposeful design:

**Project:** Mad Hudson Limited Edition Watch Collection
**Angle:** Artist-designed watch with integrated brand + packaging storytelling

Each limited-edition watch (100 pieces) is designed by a collaborating artist. The packaging and visual
identity extend the artist's creative vision, from unboxing experience to material choices.

**Design Story:**
- Artist-led design direction (not brand-led)
- Packaging that reflects artist's creative practice
- Limited production as intentional scarcity (not artificial exclusivity)
- Sustainable materials + artist economics integrated into design narrative

**What Makes This Interesting:**
- Authentic artist collaboration (design industry trend)
- Packaging as storytelling (not just protection)
- Creator economy angle (pre-orders fund artist)
- Small-batch production with scaled impact

**Deliverables:**
- High-res photography (watch, packaging, details, artist at work)
- Artist statement + design process documentation
- Production specs + material sourcing info

Would this be a good fit for your publication? I can provide all assets + artist interview access.

Best,
[Your Name]
```
