**You'll find all this in 3 files:**

2. `press-research-recent-coverage.md` ← Reference for personalization
3. `press-tracking-template.md` ← Your execution playbook

## 🎯 What You Need to Do (Before Feb 10)

### **Task 1: Confirm Artist Availability (30 min)**

Before pitches go out, confirm that your collaborating artists are available for interviews:

- [ ] Contact [Artist 1]: Are they available for phone/email interview in Mar-Apr?
- [ ] Contact [Artist 2]: Same question
- [ ] Confirm availability dates/times (add to pitch emails)
- [ ] Get artist quotes/bio (5-10 words each about the watch design)

**Why:** Editors will ask "Is the artist available for an interview?" Say yes = acceptance.

---

### **Task 2: Gather High-Res Images (45 min)**

Collect 5-10 high-quality images to attach to pitches:

- [ ] 2-3 photos of the watch (detail shots, hero shot, artist-designed feature)
- [ ] 1-2 photos of the artist (at work, with the watch)
- [ ] 1-2 process photos (design sketches, production, materials)
- [ ] 1-2 lifestyle/lifestyle (watch in use, unboxing, detail)
- [ ] Packaging/presentation (if visually interesting)

**Format:** JPG or PNG, high-resolution (3000px+ wide)
**Size:** Keep under 5MB per image (editors have small inboxes)

**Where to put them:** Create Google Drive folder "Mad Hudson Press Kit" and share link with team

---

### **Task 3: Verify Current Contact Info (15 min)**

Editor emails change. Before Feb 10, verify these haven't changed:

1. Go to [Muck Rack](https://muckrack.com/) (free account)
2. Search each publication name
3. Check for any updated editor contact info
4. Update `press-report-february.md` if anything changed

**Publications to check:**
- Designboom (Sofia Lekka Angelopoulou)
- Dezeen (Tom Ravenscroft)
- Hodinkee (Nick Marino)
- Creative Review (Eliza Williams)
- It's Nice That (Jenny Brewer)
- [Others listed in press-report-february.md]

---

### **Task 4: Set Up Tracking (30 min)**

Create a Google Sheet from the template to track responses in real-time:

1. Open `press-tracking-template.md` (in this folder)
2. Copy the outreach tracker table
3. Create new Google Sheet: "Mad Hudson Press Outreach"
4. Paste table as starting point
5. Share with team (view-only for most, edit for lead)

**Why:** You'll need to track when pitches are sent, who responds, and what's published.

---

## 💌 How to Send Pitches

### **Email Subject Line**
Pick ONE from press-report-february.md (customize with watch name + artist name):
- "Artist-as-Author Watch Collaboration [Watch Name] × [Artist Name]"
- Or similar angle from templates

### **Email Body**
1. **Personalization (1-2 sentences)** - Reference something they covered recently
   - "I noticed your recent coverage of emerging artists building community..."
2. **The Hook (2-3 sentences)** - What's the story?
   - "Mad Hudson positions artists as authors, not endorsers..."
3. **The Angle (2-3 sentences)** - Why this publication, this angle?
   - "Your readers care about authentic design. Here's a story about..."
4. **Offer (1-2 sentences)** - What you're providing
   - "I have interview access + high-res imagery if you'd like to explore this."
5. **CTA (1 sentence)** - Ask for response
   - "Would you be interested in a feature story?"

**See `press-tracking-template.md` for full email template (copy-paste ready)**

### **Attachments**
- 3-4 strongest high-res images
- NOTHING ELSE (keep email clean)

### **Send Timing**
- **Morning preferred** (editors check email first thing)
- **Tuesday-Thursday best** (not Monday inbox overload, not Friday distraction)
- **One pitch per day maximum** (don't spam same editor twice)

## 📊 How to Track Responses

**Use the Google Sheet you created.**

**Status codes:**
- **Sent** = Waiting for response
- **Interested** = They asked for materials / want to discuss
- **In Progress** = Assigned to writer, feature in development
- **Published** = Article live (capture URL + backlink)
- **Declined** = They passed (don't follow up)
- **No Response** = 4+ weeks, no reply (close it out)

**Follow-up rules:**
1. **2 weeks after pitch:** If no response, send ONE brief follow-up email
2. **4 weeks after pitch:** If still no response, mark as "No Response," close out
3. **Never send more than 2 emails to same editor** (1 pitch + 1 follow-up max)

See `press-tracking-template.md` for response playbooks (what to do if interested, declined, etc.)

---

## 🎁 What You'll Get

**February-May:**
- 3-5 positive responses (interested/in progress)
- 1-2 assignments (writer working on feature)
- 2-4 published articles (backlinks acquired)

**By end of Phase 2 (May 31):**
- 5-10 authority backlinks (design, watch, culture publications)
- 100+ organic search visits/month
- Brand credibility with design + watch enthusiast audiences

---

## 🚨 Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Generic pitches** → Editors get hundreds. Personalize or delete.

❌ **Spamming with follow-ups** → 1 pitch + 1 follow-up only. If they want you, they'll respond.

❌ **Sending too much stuff** → Keep initial pitch to 200-250 words + 3-4 images. Don't attach press kit (they'll ask).

❌ **Wrong angle** → See `press-research-recent-coverage.md` for what each publication values. Match the angle.

❌ **Wrong editor** → Don't send design story to tech writer. Research who covers what.

## 🎯 Success = Backlinks

Remember: **The goal is not response rate, the goal is backlinks.**

Some emails won't get responses. That's normal.

The ones that do will lead to feature articles in respected publications. Those articles = authority backlinks = SEO value for Mad Hudson.

Target: 5-10 backlinks from authority sites by May 31 = 10-20 domain authority points = 2-3x organic traffic increase.
