## 🎯 Weekly Checkpoints

### **Week 1 (Feb 10-16): Setup Phase**
```
FEB 10: Copywriter brief created ✅
FEB 12: Assets gathered ✅
FEB 13: Copy delivered ✅
FEB 14: Copy approved ✅
FEB 15: Phase 1 live ✅
FEB 16: Baseline captured ✅
```

**Success Metric:** All Phase 1 content live and baseline established.

---

### **Week 2 (Feb 17-23): Detection Phase**
```
FEB 17: First post-Phase-1 ranking snapshot
  → Likely little/no movement (Google still crawling)
  → Establish trend line

FEB 19: Connor reviews rankings
  → Document baseline for comparison

FEB 24: Week 2 ranking snapshot
  → Should see some movement (2-3 keywords)
  → Google has had 9 days to re-crawl
```

**Success Metric:** Agents reporting on schedule. Connor tracking.

---

### **Week 3-4 (Feb 24 - Mar 2): Early Signals Phase**
```
FEB 24: Week 2 snapshot shows early movement
  → 2-3 keywords Page 2 → Page 1 bottom (expected)
  → Confirm strategy is working

MAR 2: Week 3 snapshot
  → More keywords moving
  → Traffic uptick from product pages expected by early March

MAR 15: Phase 1 mid-point checkpoint
  → 4-5 keywords showing movement
  → Early success indicators visible
```

**Success Metric:** 2-3 keywords definitely moving up. Traffic increasing.

---

### **Week 5-8 (Mar 3 - Apr 7): Impact Phase**
```
MAR 17: Week 5 snapshot
  → 3-4 keywords moving toward top 3
  → Organic traffic 20-30 visits/month

MAR 31: End-of-month analytics report
  → Phase 1 impact clearly visible
  → March organic visits up 2x from baseline

APR 7: PHASE 1 CHECKPOINT ← CRITICAL DECISION GATE
  → Are 3-5 keywords now in top 3? ✅ = SUCCESS
  → Is organic traffic 30-50+ visits/month? ✅ = SUCCESS
  → If YES: Proceed to Phase 2 (blog launch)
  → If NO: Pause and reassess strategy
```

**Success Metric:** 3-5 keywords in top 3. 30-50 visits/month.

---

## 🚨 Risk Mitigation

### **Risk: Copy misses Phase 1 deadline (Feb 13)**
- **Mitigation:** Brief given Feb 10 with clear requirements. Follow-up Feb 12 if no check-in.
- **Escalate:** If still late Feb 13, Connor hires backup copywriter or writes copy himself.

### **Risk: Shopify deployment delayed (Feb 15)**
- **Mitigation:** Connor has clear instructions by Feb 14. Schema markup can be deployed separately if needed.
- **Escalate:** If delayed past Feb 16, notify SEO Monitor to shift baseline capture.

### **Risk: Google doesn't re-rank content quickly (Feb 17)**
- **Mitigation:** This is normal. Google takes 2-4 weeks for major re-crawling.
- **Escalate:** If NO movement by March 3, investigate: Did upload work? Did schema validate? Are keywords too competitive?

### **Risk: Phase 1 checkpoint fails (Apr 7)**
- **Mitigation:** Built-in validation gate. If <2 keywords in top 3, reassess strategy before Phase 2 investment.
- **Escalate:** SEO Monitor analyzes: Competitors responded? Keywords too competitive? Phase 2 may need different angle.
