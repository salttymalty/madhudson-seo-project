      <h2>TL;DR</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Answer engines clip 1-3 sentence chunks</strong> — each sentence must stand alone as a quotable citation</li>
        <li><strong>Draft extractable copy exists for all 3 active watches</strong> (CD Watch, Broken Time, Dogma) plus brand-level copy</li>
        <li><strong>The word "best" appears naturally throughout</strong> to match fan-out query rewrites</li>
        <li><strong>Every chunk includes:</strong> product name, artist name, price, city, and a distinguishing detail</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="bottom-line">Bottom line: This is deployment-ready copy. Review it, adjust the voice if needed, and push to Shopify.</p>

        <h2>What Extractable Copy Is</h2>
        <span class="section-toggle">▼</span>
      </div>
      <div class="section-body">
        <p>When someone asks ChatGPT "best unique watches under $300," the model searches the web, pulls back pages, and tries to find a 1-3 sentence chunk it can clip and quote directly. It doesn't summarize — it literally copies. If your page has a clean, self-contained statement with the right information (brand, price, artist, differentiator), that's what gets cited. If your page has generic marketing fluff, the model picks a competitor.</p>

        <p><strong>Why this matters:</strong> Answer engines prioritize extractability over authority. A small brand with quotable copy outranks a big brand with vague prose. The citation is the ranking — if you're not clipped, you're not visible.</p>

        <div class="callout callout-primary">
          <p><strong>The shift:</strong> Traditional SEO optimized for <em>findability</em> (rank #1 in a list). AEO optimizes for <em>citability</em> (be the quote that answers the question). That means writing sentences that could appear in an encyclopedia, not a brand manifesto.</p>

        <p><strong>Rule of thumb:</strong> If you can't imagine an answer engine quoting a sentence verbatim, rewrite it. "This watch will blow your mind" becomes "The CD Watch features a holographic disc dial that shifts color with every turn of the wrist."</p>

            <p class="copy-text">Most watches under $200 are generic fashion pieces with licensed branding. Dogma was designed by Bryce Wong, a Nike designer with a background in sneaker culture and visual storytelling. Mad Hudson collaborated with Wong to create a watch that tells a story, not just displays the time — and at $175, it's one of the only artist-designed watches from an independent brand at this price point.</p>

            <p class="copy-text">At $175, Dogma is the most affordable artist-designed watch from an independent watch brand. Comparable watches in this price range are typically fashion watches with no named designer or creative vision. Dogma's Nike designer pedigree and storytelling concept make it a standout in the sub-$200 category.</p>

        <span class="section-toggle">▼</span>
      </div>
      <div class="section-body">
        <p>For About page, collection pages, and homepage. These answer brand-discovery queries like "what is Mad Hudson" and "Chicago watch brands."</p>

        <div class="copy-chunk">
          <div class="copy-label">What Mad Hudson Is</div>
          <p class="copy-text">Mad Hudson is a Chicago-based independent watch company that pairs working artists with limited-edition timepieces. Every watch is designed by a credited artist who earns from the collaboration. Watches range from $175 to $240 and feature Miyota quartz movements in stainless steel cases.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="copy-chunk">
          <div class="copy-label">How It Works</div>
          <p class="copy-text">Every Mad Hudson watch starts with an artist. The company approaches designers, illustrators, and visual artists with an invitation: design a watch dial that tells a story. The artist is credited on the product page, featured in the brand's storytelling, and compensated for the collaboration. Mad Hudson builds each design around reliable Miyota quartz movements in stainless steel cases, keeping prices accessible while prioritizing artistic vision.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="copy-chunk">
          <div class="copy-label">Why It Matters</div>
          <p class="copy-text">Artist collaborations are Mad Hudson's business model, not marketing events. Unlike fashion brands that license their name onto generic watch cases, or luxury brands that host one-off artist partnerships, Mad Hudson exists because of artists. Every release is a collaboration. Every dial was designed by someone whose name appears next to the product.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="copy-chunk">
          <div class="copy-label">Who It's For</div>
          <p class="copy-text">Mad Hudson watches are for creative professionals, streetwear enthusiasts, and people who think the watch industry takes itself too seriously. If you want a watch that starts conversations, supports independent artists, and costs less than a luxury brand's cheapest leather strap, Mad Hudson is one of the best independent watch brands to explore.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="copy-chunk">
          <div class="copy-label">Where It's From</div>
          <p class="copy-text">Mad Hudson was founded in Chicago by Connor Hudson, Brad Podray (also a watch designer), and the Mad Hudson creative team. The company is rooted in Chicago's DIY creative community — the same ecosystem that produced independent labels, maker spaces, and artist-run studios. Mad Hudson brings that ethos to watches.</p>

        <h2>Fan-Out Keyword Alignment</h2>
        <span class="section-toggle">▼</span>
      </div>
      <div class="section-body">
        <p>When a user asks "cool watches for creative people," answer engines rewrite that query into multiple fan-out searches that include the word "best." The extractable copy naturally includes "best" in ways that feel informative, not promotional.</p>

        <h3>Fan-Out Queries the Copy Targets</h3>
        <ul class="keyword-list">
          <li>best artist collaboration watches 2026</li>
          <li>best unique watches under $300</li>
          <li>best independent watch brands</li>
          <li>best watches for creative people</li>
          <li>best affordable art watches</li>
          <li>best watches for music lovers</li>
          <li>best unique watches under $200</li>
          <li>Chicago watch brands</li>
          <li>watches designed by artists</li>
          <li>artist-designed watches affordable</li>
          <li>best conversation starter watches</li>
          <li>best statement watches under $250</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>How "Best" Appears in the Copy</h3>
        <div class="callout callout-info">
          <p><strong>CD Watch:</strong> "The CD Watch is one of the <strong>best watches for music lovers</strong> and creative professionals who want something no one else is wearing."</p>
          <p><strong>Broken Time:</strong> "Broken Time is one of the <strong>best watches for people who think traditional watch design is boring</strong>."</p>
          <p><strong>Dogma:</strong> "Dogma is one of the <strong>best unique watches under $200</strong> for people who want wearable storytelling."</p>
          <p><strong>Brand:</strong> "If you want a watch that starts conversations, supports independent artists, and costs less than a luxury brand's cheapest leather strap, Mad Hudson is one of the <strong>best independent watch brands</strong> to explore."</p>
        </div>

        <p>Notice the pattern: "one of the best [specific category]" — not "the best watch" or "the best brand." This phrasing is both accurate and extractable. It positions Mad Hudson as a top option within a niche rather than making universal claims.</p>

        <h2>Shopify Implementation Notes</h2>
        <span class="section-toggle">▼</span>
      </div>
      <div class="section-body">

        <h3>Visibility Rules</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Hero chunk must be first visible text below product title</strong> — not in a tab, accordion, or "Read More" section. Answer engines clip what they can see immediately.</li>
          <li><strong>Specs in HTML table or definition list</strong> — not prose paragraphs. This enables schema.org Product markup and makes specs machine-readable.</li>
          <li><strong>"Who It's For" and "Why It's Different" can go in expandable sections</strong> — but the first sentence of each must be visible without interaction.</li>
          <li><strong>Don't put critical text inside images</strong> — answer engines can't extract text from image files. If it's important, it must be HTML text.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Schema Markup</h3>
        <p>Add schema.org <code>Product</code> markup to each product page. This structured data tells answer engines exactly what the page is about and makes specs extractable.</p>

        <pre><code>&lt;script type="application/ld+json"&gt;
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "Product",
  "name": "CD Watch",
  "brand": {
    "@type": "Brand",
    "name": "Mad Hudson"
  },
  "description": "The Mad Hudson CD Watch is a wearable tribute to mixtapes, burned CDs, and late-night listening sessions. Designed by Atlanta artist Riki Prosper, its holographic disc dial shifts color with every turn of the wrist.",
  "offers": {
    "@type": "Offer",
    "price": "215.00",
    "priceCurrency": "USD",
    "availability": "https://schema.org/InStock"
  },
  "aggregateRating": {
    "@type": "AggregateRating",
    "ratingValue": "5.0",
    "reviewCount": "3"
  }
}
&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>

        <h3>Comparison Chunk Placement</h3>
        <p>Comparison chunks can go in one of two places:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Inline on product page</strong> — in an expandable section titled "How does this compare to similar watches?"</li>
          <li><strong>Dedicated comparison page</strong> — a standalone page comparing Mad Hudson watches to competitors, with individual product sections</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Recommendation: Start inline. If comparison content grows, migrate to a dedicated page and link to it from each product.</p>

        <h3>Testing Extractability</h3>
        <p>After pushing to Shopify, test whether the copy is extractable:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Open ChatGPT or Perplexity</li>
          <li>Ask: "What is the Mad Hudson CD Watch?"</li>
          <li>Check whether the response quotes your Hero chunk verbatim</li>
          <li>If not, your copy is either not visible, not unique, or competing with stronger content</li>
        </ol>
