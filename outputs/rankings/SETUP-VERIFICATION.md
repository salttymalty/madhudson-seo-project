## Autonomous Operations

### What Happens Automatically

**Every Monday at 9:00 AM:**
1. SEO Monitor captures current ranking positions
2. Compares to previous week
3. Generates WEEKLY-[DATE].md report
4. Flags if any keyword moved 3+ positions

**Every Month End:**
1. SEO Monitor consolidates 4 weeks of data
2. Generates MONTHLY-[MONTH-YEAR].md report
3. Tracks progress against success criteria
4. Provides recommended actions

**On Movement Detection:**
1. Flag prominently in report if 3+ position shift
2. Document competitor movement if observed
3. Identify new keywords emerging
4. Suggest recommended actions

### What Connor Needs to Do

- Review monthly reports (takes 5 min)
- Check WEEKLY reports if curious about latest
- Focus on Phase 1 execution (meta, stories, schema)
- Watch Apr 7 checkpoint date

---

## Success Metrics at a Glance

### Phase 1 Target (by April 7, 2026 — 8 weeks)
- 3-5 keywords move from Page 2 → top 3
- "watches for creators" enters top 20
- "watches that fund artists" enters top 20
- +30-50 organic visits/month

### 6-Month Target (by August 31, 2026)
- Own "watches for creators" cluster
- 5+ keywords in top 10
- 300-500+ organic visits/month
- 2-3x baseline traffic

## Quality Assurance

### Data Quality
- [x] Baseline verified with manual SERP analysis
- [x] Keyword selection matches SEO audit findings
- [x] Methodology documented for reproducibility
- [x] Timeline realistic (6-8 weeks for Phase 1 impact)

### Documentation Quality

- [x] Accessible to non-technical users (Connor)
- [x] Technical details available (for team)
- [x] Templates created for consistency

### System Reliability
- [x] No external dependencies (local files + git)
- [x] Fallback method ready (manual SERP until GSC)
- [x] Movement detection automated

---

## Known Limitations

1. **Manual SERP Analysis** (until GSC configured)
   - Less precise than GSC data
   - Dependent on timing of capture
   - Subject to personalization factors
   - Workaround: Manual verification method documented

2. **Limited Competitive Intelligence** (until GSC)
   - Can't track competitor clicks/impressions
   - Only visible movement is observable
   - Workaround: Competitor monitoring added to Phase 2

3. **No Traffic Correlation** (until Analytics)
   - Can't yet tie rankings to actual visits
   - Estimated based on keyword volume
   - Workaround: Analytics correlation in Phase 2
