## 🎯 PITCH PERSONALIZATION EXAMPLES

### **For Designboom**
"Sofia, I know Designboom covers emerging design brands with authentic stories. Mad Hudson is doing something different—positioning artists as authors, not endorsers. The new [Watch Name] collaboration shows this philosophy clearly: [Artist Name] led the entire design vision..."

### **For Hodinkee**
"Hi Nick, I've followed Hodinkee's coverage of independent watchmakers doing serious design work. Mad Hudson sits in that space—but uniquely positioned around artist collaboration. The [Watch Name] is a design-first project where [Artist Name] approached the challenge as a creative problem, not a commercial one..."
