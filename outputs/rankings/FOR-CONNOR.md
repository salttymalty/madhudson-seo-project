## What This Is

Your Mad Hudson Watches rankings are now being monitored automatically. This document explains what you need to know.

---

## The Basics

**What we're tracking:** 7 keywords your SEO audit identified as opportunities

**How often:** Weekly snapshots every Monday at 9:00 AM

**Where to find reports:** `/outputs/rankings/` directory

**First report:** Monday, February 17, 2026

## 3 Things to Know

### 1. Read This (5 min)
**File:** `/outputs/rankings/QUICK-REFERENCE.md`

One-page guide with:
- What keywords we're tracking
- Where to find reports
- Key dates to watch
- Success criteria

### 2. Check This (Monthly)
**Files:** `/outputs/rankings/MONTHLY-[MONTH-YEAR].md`

End-of-month reports showing:
- What moved (which keywords, how much)
- Progress toward success criteria
- What to do next

### 3. Watch This (April 7)
**Date:** April 7, 2026 — Week 8 checkpoint

This is the critical date. By then, you should see:
- 3-5 keywords move from Page 2 to top 3
- "watches for creators" entering top 20
- +30-50 new organic visits/month

If this happens, Phase 1 worked. If not, we reassess.

## Keywords We're Tracking

|---------|---|---|---|
| ⭐ watches for creators | Not ranking | Top 20 | Top 5 |
| ⭐ artist-made watches | Page 2 | Top 5 | Top 1-3 |
| artist watches | Page 2 | Top 10 | Top 5 |

## How It Works

**Every Monday:** I capture current ranking positions and compare to the previous week.

**Every month:** I consolidate the data and generate a report with trends and recommendations.

**If something big happens:** I flag it. (Like if a keyword suddenly jumps 5 positions.)

**You:** Review the monthly reports. They take 5 minutes.

## What Success Looks Like

### Week 4 (March 17)
- Some keywords might be shifting position
- "watches for creators" still probably not ranking (too early)
- Normal variation between -2 and +2 positions

### Week 8 (April 7) ← **CRITICAL**
- **Expected:** 3-5 keywords in top 3 (were on Page 2)
- **Expected:** "watches for creators" enters ranking
- **Expected:** +30-50 organic visits/month

If this happens: Phase 1 worked. Plan Phase 2.
If not: Investigate implementation, reassess strategy.

### Month 2 (April 30)
- Sustained momentum
- Keywords solidifying in top positions
- Clear ROI from Phase 1 optimization

### 6 Months (August 31)
- "watches for creators" in top 5
- Own the artist/creator keyword cluster
- 300-500+ organic visits/month

## Questions?

**Q: What if nothing happens by April 7?**
A: We investigate. Check if Phase 1 was implemented completely. Assess keyword selection. Consider strategy adjustments for Phase 2.

**Q: Can I see weekly reports?**
A: Yes. Check `/outputs/rankings/WEEKLY-[DATE].md` any Monday afternoon. But you don't need to — monthly reports are better.

**Q: What if a competitor moves?**
A: I'll flag it in the monthly report. Usually means Phase 2 press/link strategy is important.

**Q: Can I change keywords?**
A: Yes. Let me know. I'll update future reports. (Baseline doesn't change, but future reports can track new keywords too.)

**Q: When do I see traffic increase?**
A: Rankings first, then traffic follows (with 1-2 week lag typically). So late April if all goes well.

## Bottom Line

Your rankings are being monitored automatically. Weekly snapshots capture position changes. Monthly reports consolidate the data and provide recommendations. Critical checkpoint is April 7 — that's when Phase 1 optimization should show results. Check monthly reports for updates.

Focus on Phase 1 execution now. Rankings take 6-8 weeks to move.
