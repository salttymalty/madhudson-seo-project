**Resolution:** Provide one of:
1. GA read-only view link (PREFERRED)
2. GSC read-only view link (ALSO GOOD)
3. Manual export/screenshot of Feb 9-28 traffic (ACCEPTABLE)

**Action:** Connor to provide data access by FEB 12
**Severity:** 🟡 Low (doesn't block Phase 1 execution, only baseline measurement)
